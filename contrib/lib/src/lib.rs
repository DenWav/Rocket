//! This crate contains officially sanctioned contributor libraries that provide
//! functionality commonly used by Rocket applications.
//!
//! These libraries are always kept in-sync with the core Rocket library. They
//! provide common, but not fundamental, abstractions to be used by Rocket
//! applications.
//!
//! Each module in this library is held behind a feature flag, with the most
//! common modules exposed by default. The present feature list is below, with
//! an asterisk next to the features that are enabled by default:
//!
//! * [serve*](serve) - Static File Serving
//! * [handlebars_templates](templates) - Handlebars Templating
//! * [tera_templates](templates) - Tera Templating
//! * [uuid](uuid) - UUID (de)serialization
//! * [${database}_pool](databases) - Database Configuration and Pooling
//! * [helmet](helmet) - Fairing for Security and Privacy Headers
//!
//! The recommend way to include features from this crate via Rocket in your
//! project is by adding a `[dependencies.rocket_contrib]` section to your
//! `Cargo.toml` file, setting `default-features` to false, and specifying
//! features manually. For example, to use the `tera_templates` module, you
//! would add:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.rocket_contrib]
//! version = "0.5.0-dev"
//! default-features = false
//! features = ["tera_templates"]
//! ```
//!
//! This crate is expected to grow with time, bringing in outside crates to be
//! officially supported by Rocket.
