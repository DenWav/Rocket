//! Types and traits to build and send responses.
//!
//! The return type of a Rocket handler can be any type that implements the
//! [`Responder`](crate::response::Responder) trait, which means that the type knows
//! how to generate a [`Response`]. Among other things, this module contains
//! several such types.
//!
//! # Composing
//!
//! Many of the built-in `Responder` types _chain_ responses: they take in
//! another `Responder` and add, remove, or change information in the response.
//! In other words, many `Responder` types are built to compose well. As a
//! result, you'll often have types of the form `A<B<C>>` consisting of three
//! `Responder`s `A`, `B`, and `C`. This is normal and encouraged as the type
//! names typically illustrate the intended response.
//!
//! # Contrib
//!
//! The [`contrib` crate] contains several useful `Responder`s including
//! [`Template`] and [`Json`].
//!
//! [`contrib` crate]: ../../rocket_contrib
//! [`Template`]: ../../rocket_contrib/templates/struct.Template.html
//! [`Json`]: ../../rocket_contrib/json/struct.Json.html
