//! Phoenix-like channels for Rocket websockets.
//!
//! The implementation is somewhat complex, but quite flexible. A `Channel` object is created to
//! share messages using a subscription based model. A client can subscribe to a specific
//! descriptor in a channel, using the methods provided by the `Channel` object. See the
//! documentation for the `ChannelDescriptor` trait for more information on the matching process.
//!
//! Typically, a Channel will be created and added to the state that Rocket manages. This is
//! nessecary since Rocket needs to know what type you would like to use as the `ChannelDescriptor`,
//! and it also allows mutiple channels, depending on the descriptor type.
